Filterchips is a UI component that lets you add an aligned field of chips that can be used for filtering.

`FilterChipViewContainer` is instantiated with an array of `FilterChipView`s. These are aligned automatically in a line breaking layout based on a given configuration.

Currently, the `FilterChipViewContainer.Configuration` is pretty basic.
It supports configuring the alignment, vertical margin between the chips and the horizontal margins between rows.
